# ChatGPT Discord Bot

My GPT Discord bot remembers the last 50 interactions with it in the chat. It responds to pings and will ping you back with its response. It also responds to being replied to.

## Installation
1. Create a new file called `.env` in the root of your project
2. Add your OpenAI API key and your Discord bot token
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
4. Run `node app.js` to start the bot
